# 📊 Trading Profit Patterns

## 📌 Overview
**Python-based quantitative analysis** of high-frequency EURUSD price data.  

The project detects **short-term bullish and bearish patterns** and evaluates their predictive reliability using **1-minute and 2-minute candle data**.  

Demonstrates **data cleaning, aggregation, vectorized analysis, and reproducible workflows** for high-volume financial datasets.

## ⚙️ Workflow

### 1️⃣ System Recognition
- **Domain:** Forex high-frequency price pattern analysis  
- **Goal:** Identify statistically significant short-term patterns  
- **Constraint:** Efficiently handle millions of candles with reproducible analysis

### 2️⃣ Data Collection
- Source: [Kaggle – Forex EURUSD 1m Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitjha420/forex-eurusd-1m-data-2015-to-2021)  
- Aggregate raw 1-minute data into 2-minute intervals

### 3️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Deduplicate and sort data chronologically  
- Standardize columns and handle missing or unnecessary data  

### 4️⃣ Exploratory Analysis
- Compute candle features (body, top/bottom wicks)  
- Detect upward (bullish) and downward (bearish) patterns  
- Evaluate subsequent interval outcomes for reliability

### 5️⃣ Visualization
- Display representative **upward and downward patterns** for visual inspection  

**Upward Pattern:**

### 6️⃣ Insights
- **Patterns detected:** 81,938  
- **Success rate:** 51%  
- High-frequency price series are **noise-dominated**; short-term patterns show limited predictive power  
- Modular workflow ensures **reproducibility and scalability**
